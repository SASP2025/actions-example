# This action will execute pytest
# Schema: https://json.schemastore.org/github-action.json
# This should include a GitHub summary report in the test
# It is up to the workflow caller to setup their environment
# setup configuration for pytest should be in a pyproject.toml file
# you may need to edit the toml to get all the options, but coverage should be here
